* Develop cooling efficiency/capacity estimates
* Projections ->Make future projections along the SSP storylines on the future evolution of UGBS and of its potential synergistic mitigation-adaptation role level for a globally-representative pool of cities ... global north / global south difference (intensification vs. extensification), use urbanisation and population existing gridded projections

GIACOMO

* Summaries of climate changeâ€™s role and the contribution of UGS to adaptation (heat reduction) and mitigation (energy use reduction) goals
* Mortality/air pollution analysis
